Change in version 1.0.2:

   - Some changes in order of loading packages to work with 
xepersion1.0.4.

   - In xepersian 1.0.4, if we don't define latin fornt, it uses latex 
default font, which in xetex is "latin modern" (unicode implementation of 
traditional "computer modern" fonts). It uses latex fonts, not windows 
fonts. I changed the file to this case.

   - "MBZ_ThesisSettings.sty" updated to version 1.0.2.

   - Title of chapter 2 was chagned!

Change in version 1.0.1: 

   - (note: this change is obsolete after xepersian1.0.4. I thas been 
removed in future versions).
     English font (using \setlatintextfont) is now CMR10 (Computer Modern 
Roman) font, which is the traditional LaTeX font. To use it, you have to 
install ttf version of Computer Modern fonts. This can be downloaded from:

   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/ttf/

  Scaling of this font has been also changed to 1 (from 1.1).
