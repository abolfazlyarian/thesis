\baselineskip=0.4\baselineskip
In the digital world today, invisible and robust image watermarking which embeds invisible signals
in to the digital images has been proposed as a major solution to the problem of copyright protection 
of digital images. Several approaches such as exploiting Human Visual System (HVS) and invariant domain
watermarking have been proposed to achieve this goal. In this thesis we use the information-theoretic
concepts as tools to develop methods for embedding watermark in an optimized way. Also multi-resolution 
transforms such as wavelet transform and MR-SVD (Multi-Resolution form of the Singular Value Decomposition)
are used in the proposed structure, because theses transforms resemble the HVS characteristics  for an
optimized watermarking  structure. Entropy concept and entropy~masking effects were proposed to use to develop
a model in DWT domain to increase the strength and robustness of the watermark, while perceived quality
of the electronic image is not altered. 
Then, the structure similar to the entropy-based proposed structure in DWT domain, 
is used for watermarking in the MR-SVD transform domain, which is found a new approach to robust image 
watermarking. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform conventional methods
in terms of both invisibility and robustness.  \\
